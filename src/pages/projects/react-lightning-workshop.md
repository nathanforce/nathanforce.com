[React Lightning Workshop](https://github.com/jayjaycross/lightning-workshop) is a workshop series created by myself and a friend of mine, [Jack Cross](https://twitter.com/jayjaycross), to help developers practice creating thoughtful, reusable React components.  We crafted the workshop material to ease attendees into some more advanced approaches of structuring a React application.

Attendees are given mockups of some common UI features, like a color picker or a clock, and we task them with creating a solution using React.  After some time, we demonstrate an example solution that we've created and work through any trouble areas that may have come up.  The variations purposefully build on one another to help demonstrate a particular concept.

Leading a workshop like this was a personal first for me, and wow I am glad I was involved!  There's such a buzz that comes from sharing a passion of yours with others.  It is a truly magical feeling when an attendee has their "ah hah" moment and you can see the wheels start turning for them.

I am hoping that we can continue iterating on this workshop, adding more components and hosting more sessions in the future.
