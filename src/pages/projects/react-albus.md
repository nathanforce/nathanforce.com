[React Albus](https://github.com/americanexpress/react-albus) is a React component library for building declarative multi-step flows.  It was developed at American Express by myself and my colleague [Jack Cross](https://twitter.com/crosscompile).  React Albus was my first time writing code to be consumed by other developers.  I found this mindset shift to be hugely valuable to my approach to development, as it lends itself nicely to writing clear, concise, and focused code.

As we developed this project, we learned the power of obsession, iteration, and perfectionism.  Since this thing was going into the wild, we wanted everything to be perfect! This led to countless hours obsessing over the smallest details of the API, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I credit a lot of what I know about React component development today to this project.
